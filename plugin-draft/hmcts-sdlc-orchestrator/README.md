# hmcts-sdlc-orchestrator

Bundled Claude Code plugin that ships the **HMCTS SDLC pipeline** for the Crime Common Platform (CPP) — agents, skills, hooks, commands, context docs, and the orchestrator `CLAUDE.md` in one installable plugin.

## What's inside

| Component | Items |
|---|---|
| **Agents** (`agents/`) | requirements-analyst, architecture-designer, story-writer, test-engineer, implementation, code-reviewer, ci-orchestrator, deployer, plus auxiliaries (doc-generator, event-flow-mapper, helm-config-validator, migration-reviewer, rbac-auditor, research, test-analyzer) |
| **Skills** (`skills/`) | springboot-service-from-template, springboot-api-from-template, cpp-test-authoring, context-service-guide, context-scaffold, api-contract-check, architecture-design, dependency-audit, pipeline-debug, review-pr, terraform-validate, openspec-* |
| **Hooks** (`hooks/`) | guard-bash, guard-paths, block-pii, block-secrets, enforce-gate, harness-telemetry, record-gate, `git/post-commit`, `git/post-rewrite`, `git/pre-push` |
| **Commands** (`commands/`) | gate, opsx/* |
| **Context** (`context/`) | tech-stack, hmcts-standards, azure-cloud-native, azure-sdk-guide, cloud-adoption-rationale, coding-standards, logging-standards |
| **Orchestration** | `CLAUDE.md` — the 8-stage pipeline definition |

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code with the [agentic-plugins-marketplace](https://github.com/hmcts/agentic-plugins-marketplace) registered
- For `openspec-*` commands: the `openspec` CLI on your `PATH` (see `commands/opsx/` for details)
- GitHub MCP or Jenkins MCP configured if using the CI/CD pipeline agents

## Installation

```
/plugin install hmcts-sdlc-orchestrator@agentic-plugins-marketplace
```

To enable the SDLC orchestrator in a repo, copy `CLAUDE.md` from the plugin into your project root after installation:
```bash
cp ~/.claude/plugins/hmcts-sdlc-orchestrator/CLAUDE.md ./CLAUDE.md
```
This loads the 8-stage pipeline definition, context file references, and hard rules into every Claude session for that project.

## Usage example

After copying `CLAUDE.md` into your project root, start the pipeline by describing what you need:

> "Here's the brief for the new custody hearing widget — turn it into a requirements document."

Claude runs **one gated stage at a time**. It will invoke `requirements-analyst`, write
`docs/pipeline/requirements.md`, and stop. The next stage is blocked by hook until you
review the artefact and run:

```
/gate approve requirements
```

Ask for several stages at once ("requirements, stories, tests and implementation") and you
will still get only the first — the rest are blocked until each gate is approved in turn.
That is deliberate: the gates are the point of the pipeline, and prose instructions alone
were not holding them.

| `/gate` decision | Effect |
|---|---|
| `/gate approve <stage>` (or `accept`/`edit`) | next stage unblocks |
| `/gate skip <stage>` | stage does not apply to this change — treated as satisfied |
| `/gate reject <stage> <reason>` | stage stays locked, **all downstream stages reset to pending** |

`record-gate.sh --status` shows where you are. Gate state is per repo **and branch**.

If you also run another SDD framework (superpowers, BMAD, Spec-Kit), the HMCTS gate state
takes precedence over its phase-advance workflow.

For standalone skills:
> "Review this PR against CPP standards" — triggers `review-pr`
> "Validate the Helm chart for cpp-hearing" — triggers `helm-config-validator`
> "Trace the CaseOpened event" — triggers `event-flow-mapper`

## Measuring the harness

The plugin records anonymous usage so the programme can tell whether it is actually
helping. Installing the plugin enables the local event log; commit attribution needs one
extra command per machine:

```bash
git config --global core.hooksPath ~/.claude/plugins/hmcts-sdlc-orchestrator/hooks/git
```

Commits made during a session are then recorded by SHA in a local index, which is what lets
cycle time and change-failure rate be split into assisted vs. unassisted work. **Nothing is
written into the commit message** — most CPP repos are public, and an AI-assistance marker
there would be permanent and unretractable. The hooks chain to husky, so `cpp-ui-*` repos
keep commitlint, and none of them can break a commit or a push.

Record human-gate outcomes with `/gate <stage> <approve|edit|reject|skip> [reason]` — gate
rejection rate is the only direct quality signal for each pipeline agent. The same command
unlocks the next stage, so recording and enforcement cannot drift apart.

Gate bypasses are recorded too: `CPP_GATES_OVERRIDE=1` is the only way past a blocked gate,
and each use writes a `gate_override` event, making the bypass rate measurable.

**What is recorded:** session lifecycle, which skills and agents ran, artefact writes under
`docs/pipeline/`, gate decisions, and the SHAs of commits made during a session — to
`~/.cpp-harness/` on your machine, nowhere else. Deleting that directory deletes the lot.
**What is not:** prompt text, file contents, absolute paths, developer identity, or any free
text. Opt out with `CPP_HARNESS_TELEMETRY=off`.

Full spec: `docs/telemetry/attribution-index.md` and `docs/telemetry/installing.md` in the
source repo.
